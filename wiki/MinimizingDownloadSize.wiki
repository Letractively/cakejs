cake.js is 200kB without minification and compression, which is, frankly, huge.

To bring the file size (and page load times) down, you should at least minify cake.js and preferably gzip it too. 

Here are the file sizes (circa 2008-03-21):
{{{ 
cake.js        212 kB  -- plain source
cake_min.js    106 kB  -- minified
cake_min.js.gz  28 kB  -- minified and gzipped
}}}

Download times on a 384kbps 3G connection:
 * cake.js: around 5 seconds
 * cake_min.js: around 2.5 seconds
 * cake_min.js.gz: around 0.6 seconds

To minify, download [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ YUI compressor] and do the following:
{{{
java -jar yuicompressor-*.jar cake.js -o cake_min.js
}}}

To GZIP, set up your mod_deflate equivalent (instructions for [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html Apache 2] and [http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxHttpGzipModule Nginx])
